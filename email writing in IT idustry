Subject: Update on Progress for walmart project

Dear srinivas,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on the progress of walmart.

Since our last meeting, the team has made significant progress in completing the assigned tasks. We have completed python, and we are on track to complete [list upcoming tasks] by the end of the week.

However, we have encountered some unexpected roadblocks that have delayed our progress on aws. We are working on resolving this issue and will update you on the progress soon.

In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I am available to discuss the project in more detail at your convenience.

Thank you for your support and guidance on this project.

Best regards,
santosh
